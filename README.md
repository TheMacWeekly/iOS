# iOS
The best mobile platform


## Setting up on your machine

1. Install Xcode
2. Clone the iOS repo
3. Install Cocoapods
    1. enter `sudo gem install cocoapods` in the terminal (doesn't matter what directory you're in)
    2. `cd` into the iOS repo on your machine (if you use `ls` you should be able to see the .xcodeproj file among others)
    3. enter `pod install`
  
Finally, in Xcode open the **The Mac Weekly.xcodeworkspace** file, **NOT The Mac Weekly.xcodeproj** file.

_**If you open the .xcodeproj file, you will not be able to build and run**_
